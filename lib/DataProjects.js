        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our team decided to create an ontology for hip-hop music. The choice of this topic was based on several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Hip-hop music is one of the most significant and influential genres in contemporary culture, with a large global following.</li>
            <li><strong>Research Gap:</strong> Limited research exists on creating ontologies for hip-hop, with most existing ontologies focusing on classical, jazz, and rock music.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Interest:</strong> The group members have a personal interest in hip-hop, aiding in gathering information and analyzing concepts with greater enthusiasm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Identification and Analysis of Related Ontologies</h2>

        <h3>Identification of Relevant Sources</h3>
        <p>Initially, I searched for and identified ontologies related to music. The five main sources identified and reviewed were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Music Ontology:</strong> A comprehensive and widely used ontology for describing music, covering various aspects such as creation, performance, and consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Schema.org:</strong> A widely adopted framework that includes music-related data, making it an essential resource for our project.</li>
            <li><strong>DBTune Project:</strong> Utilizes the Music Ontology and focuses on integrating music data from various sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Polifonia Ontology Network (PON):</strong> Focuses on indexing, metadata, and music analysis, offering a rich structure for describing music.</li>

            <li><strong>MusicReleaseEvent:</strong> date, place, label, catalogNumber, releaseEventType.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparison and Analysis of Differences</h3>
        <p>In this stage, the differences and similarities of classes and properties among the various ontologies were examined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Track vs. MusicRecording:</strong> The class Track in Music Ontology, DBTune, and PON is similar to MusicRecording in Schema.org. Both describe individual music tracks or recordings, though they may include different properties specific to each ontology.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Properties:</strong> MusicRecording in Schema.org includes properties like isrcCode and recordingOf, which provide additional details not present in other ontologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By identifying these similarities and differences, we developed a comprehensive and detailed ontology tailored to hip-hop music, ensuring it was broad in scope and detailed in its representation.</p>

        <h2>From Sketches to Digital Graphs</h2>
        <p>After examining other ontologies, we began drawing our own ideas for the hip-hop music ontology:</p>
        <blockquote>We started with paper sketches, which helped us see how everything connected. These drawings were just the beginning, helping us talk about our ideas and make them better.</blockquote>
        <p>Then, we moved our sketches to <strong>Draw.io</strong>. This step allowed us to make our drawings clearer and more organized.</p>

        <h2>Building in Protégé</h2>
        <p>With our diagrams ready, we started building the ontology in a tool called <strong>Protégé</strong>. Here, we set up various classes representing key elements of hip-hop music, such as <em>‘Artist’, ‘Album’, ‘Track’</em>, and many more.</p>

        <h3>Key Properties Defined:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data properties:</strong> Common details across many classes, e.g., the ‘name’ property for classes like Artist, Album, and Track.</li>
            <li><strong>Object properties:</strong> Show the relationships between different classes, e.g., ‘has_recording’ connects Performances, Artists, and Groups to their Recordings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This stage involved careful editing to ensure accuracy and detail in representing the hip-hop scene. We continually refined the properties and classes to perfect the ontology.</p>

        <h2>Building the React Application</h2>
        <p>We created a React application using <code>create-react-app</code>, setting up endpoints for update and query operations with a Jena Funeski server running in the background.</p>
        <img src="/images/Ontology/3.png"/>
        <img src="/images/Ontology/4.png"/>
        <h3>Key Aspects:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Use of the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks for managing state and side-effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Data Insertion:</strong> The <code>insertData</code> function iterates over dynamic data and posts each track to the SPARQL endpoint.</li>
            <li><strong>Fetching and Parsing Data:</strong> After inserting, we fetch data from the query endpoint, parse the JSON results, and map them into your state.</li>
            <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Implemented basic pagination to enhance performance by loading tracks per page requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fetch and Update Data (Queries)</h3>
        <p>We wrote a function to update the dataset in Jena’s server from <code>data.js</code> (sample data) that we created.</p>

        <h3>Sample Data:</h3>
        <pre>
        All tracks
        Genre
        Recent
        Duration
        </pre>

        <h3>Result of Queries:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>By Genre:</strong> Results categorized by genre.</li>
            <li><strong>By Date (Recent):</strong> Recently added tracks.</li>
            <li><strong>By Duration:</strong> Tracks sorted by duration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>To run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Execute the command <code>npm i</code> in the terminal within the web app directory.</li>
            <li>Run the Jena Fuseki server in the background.</li>
            <li>Execute <code>npm run dev</code> in the web app directory.</li>
            <li>The app will run on <code>localhost</code>, and you can use the app to interact with the ontology.</li>
        </ol>
